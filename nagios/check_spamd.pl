# Program to check to make sure spamd is running and report back to nrpe for 
# nagios. The variable that most folks will want to change is "$spamc" which
# is the location of the spamc program.
# Created: 2006-11-29
# Version: 1.6.0
# Author: Erinn Looney-Triggs
# Revised: 2009-02-18

# Revision history: 
# 1.6.0: Added remote host checks and Time::HiRes thanks to Martin Mares. Also
# added a revision history, you have to start somewhere.

=head1 NAME

check_spamd - Checks the status of SpamAssassin's spamd daemon via spamc.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to check_spamd version 1.6.0

=head1 USAGE

check_spamd.pl

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 OPTIONS

--host    (-H)     Set the host on which spamd runs (default: localhost).
--port    (-p)     Set TCP port number of spamd.
--spamc   (-s)     Set the location of the spamc executable. 
--timeout (-t)     Sets the timeout, defaults to 10 seconds.


=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This is a Nagios plugin that runs spamc to check the status of the spamd
daemon. It then parses the resultant exit codes and NRPE grabs them.

The plugin is able to check spamd either at the local host or over the network.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 spamc does not exist:

The spamc program does not exist where the plugin is looking for it. By 
default check_spamd looks for spamc in /usr/local/perl/bin/spamc. This may 
not be the location of spamc on your system. Change the variable $spamc to 
fix this issue.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

spamc should be available on the checking system.
 
=head1 DEPENDENCIES
 
    check_spamd depends on the following modules:
    Switch          Standard Perl 5.8 module
    POSIX           Standard Perl 5.8 module
    Getopt::Std     Standard Perl 5.8 module
    Time::HiRes     Standard Perl 5.8 module
    
=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
